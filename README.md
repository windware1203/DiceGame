## Rule
Roll two dice. Each die has six faces representing values 1, 2, . . ., and 6, respec- tively. Check the sum of the two dice. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called craps), you lose; if the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural), you win; if the sum is another value (i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), a point is established. Continue to roll the dice until either a 7 or the same point value is rolled. If 7 is rolled, you lose. Otherwise, you win.
